TUMS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS),"Introduction:
 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS until the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet, thus MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are performing research on this field from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delayed disability.
 
MS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides  18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS in Tehran University of Medical sciences and invited authorities from other countries.",Must have background in Neurology,Variable,Unrestricted,Unrestricted,Variable,Unrestricted,"In this 18-month program, fellows would receive comprehensive training in the clinical evaluation and management of the patient with MS and related disorders in both adult and pediatric populations. Fellows will also have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of original clinical research projects involving all aspects of MS. Fellows are encouraged to design original projects that relate to their interests. There is special focus on Neuroradiology and MRI-based research and training. It is our intent to produce clinically and academically well-trained individuals who will be able to contribute in advancing the state of knowledge of multiple sclerosis and improving the care given to the MS patients. We will take honor in supporting our trainees academically and personally as they begin their careers as MS specialists. Given that most clinical trials in MS have an MRI component as an outcome measure, considerable effort and time of a MS-specialized neurologist is devoted to analysis of the MRI scans of the patients. Intensive individual training is offered in this program by our neuroradiologist and neurologist with special expertise in multiple sclerosis. Our program is designed for those applicants who do not have the license to practice medicine in Iran. It will provide the fellows with the opportunity to fully master their ability to use MRI as a diagnostic tool as well as an outcome measure in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions in MS.  In addition, the fellows will participate in research programs and become skilled in the MRI based research, mainly conventional MRI techniques.",1,https://www.internationalscholarships.com/scholarships/2145/

Postdoc Fellowship - Nanotechnology Research Network,Jimma University,"Nanotechnology Research Network is a project organized by the National Institute of Arts & Sciences and American Nano Society for activating research groups in different universities and connect them through joint projects. An active group is located in Department of Materials Science & Engineering at Jimma University, Ethiopia. The group is chaired by Professor Ali Eftekhari, President of the American Nano Society. 

We have a unique strategy in leading the team. Thus, please carefully read the job description before applying. 


* This is part of a chair system in which assistant/associate professors work under supervision of a chair, and you will be officially appointed as an assistant or associate professor. This is indeed equivalent to the modern postdoc model in the United States and other countries. 

* You will work in a team of 15 - 20 postdoc fellows coming from different countries. 

* Due to the team structure, flexibility to be supervised is one of the main criteria. 

* Contrary to many postdoc fellowships, the present position is not focused on a specific research project. Instead, the postdoc fellows are involved in different tasks from research to academic affairs. The main theme is to empower the team members with various academic skills. 

* The postdoc fellows should necessarily start to work on a new research topic (different from their past experiences), and normally involved in literature review during the first six months. The goal is to publish review article or book. 

* The department is quite young, and you are part of the team developing the department. While initiatives have potential opportunities and excellent experiences for academic career, everything is not perfect. 

* We are looking for people who are ambitious and want to take this step as a jump in his/her academic career (e.g., appointment at top universities). There is no room for people who are interested in routine jobs for today. 

* A significant part of this position is teaching duties. 

* Each member should be committed to the team promotion internationally. Skills for networking are critically important. 

* The salary is about $24,000 - $30,000, which is quite high considering the cost of living (i.e. four times higher than local full professors). Housing and flights will be covered. On the other hand, we are looking for those who are interested in the potentials of this position rather than a routine job with high salary. 

* Jimma city is probably different from your imagination about Africa. The nature is greener than Europe, and the weather is always at excellent condition (18 - 25 C).

Master in International Security Studies (MISS),"Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague","Master in International Security Studies (MISS) is a two-year English-language Master's degree program, which offers students a complex guide through security, conflict and strategic studies in the context of international relations. It is taught at prestigious Charles University in Prague, the oldest and the largest university in Prague.

MISS promotes a progressive approach to teaching which, among other things, includes reducing class sizes and an emphasis on seminars.  The pedagogical instructors aim to conduct their classes through presentations, discussions or simulations incorporating students, rather than through a one-sided monologue of facts which can be acquired by other means.  This logically requires thorough preparation on the part of the student outside the class through extensive reading of the course texts.  The main goal of this is to streamline the teaching process through actively involving the students in class and making it possible for them to present their opinions on and understandings of the material.

Graduates of the program are prepared to pursue careers in security-related posts in government offices and public administration, international organizations, NGOs and transnational corporations.

Requirements:
The Master in International Security Studies is open only to students who have already completed (or are about to complete) a Bachelor's degree.
English-language ability. It is assumed that applicants will have a sufficient knowledge of English to attend classes and write papers in English. Although we welcome TOEFL and IELTS, they are not necessarily a condition of entry. A real ability to study in English is more important.

Tuition fees for the Master in International Security Studies program are set at 3,000 Euro per semester, payable at the start of each semester. 
Thanks to a generous contribution from the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, the Faculty of Social Sciences is able to offer a limited number of partial scholarships for students of the English-taught programs. The scholarships are earmarked for students from developing countries and/or countries going through a process of political and economic transition.",,Not available,Czech Republic,Unrestricted,April 30th,Czech Republic,,Limited,https://www.internationalscholarships.com/scholarships/2337/

TUMS Multiple Sclerosis Fellowship,Tehran University of Medical Sciences,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that usually affects young and middle-aged adults and causes a considerable social and economic burden. During recent years MS has become one of the most common reasons for admissions to a neurological ward. Now MS is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS for the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet; thus, MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are conducting research on this field ranging from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with the introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delay disability.
 
MS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing of the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides 18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis.

PhD Position in HPC - Robust Scheduling,University of Basel,"High performance computing systems consume and dissipate a great amount of power. Excessive heat dissipation requires aggressive cooling and extra space that adds to the power consumption and infrastructure cost. Moreover, as the sizes of the system as well as the system temperature rapidly increase, high system failure rates are observed. Thus, a feature of interest for scheduling scientific applications in such environments is support for fault detection and management. This characterizes the quality aspect of the time-to-solution. 
A solution to the application-level resilience to faults problem must meet the following requirements: (i) Efficiency, without compromising performance; (ii) The reliability level must be user controlled – greater reliability incurs a higher cost (either in terms of resources, CPU time, energy consumption, or allocation price); and (iii) Minimal code changes in the application. Scheduling algorithms that detect faults and are able to manage them are called fault tolerant (or resilient to faults). The most common fault tolerance strategies include task replication (via double or triple modular redundancy) and application checkpointing. However, it is unclear which of the existing solutions will scale to the size of the exascale computing systems expected by the beginning of the next decade.","Required qualifications 

We are looking for candidates who are highly motivated to conduct quality research, publish in top venues, and pursue a doctoral degree in Computer Science, with a focus on High Performance Computing. Applicants must have:

A Master’s degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Mathematics
Very good programming skills (C, C++, Java);
Very good knowledge of operating systems, in particular Linux;
Fluency in English (verbally and in writing), while knowledge of German, although not required, can be a plus
Strong team-­working abilities; and

PhD Position in HPC - Multilevel Scheduling,University of Basel,"The need for large-scale computations or for supporting large data-intensive calculations leads to the use of multiple (clusters of) parallel computers at different sites distributed across the Internet. The computational grid and cloud are examples of such distributed (possibly heterogeneous) computing systems and offer multiple hierarchical levels of parallelism: site, cluster, node, socket, core, vector, pipeline, and instruction1. Each level of parallelism requires at least a scheduler. For instance, at the cluster level there are batch schedulers and runtime systems. Depending on the level of parallelism, schedulers can be viewed as global and local. From a site level parallelism perspective, global schedulers distribute the computational tasks or the communication among the different sites, whereas local schedulers distribute the tasks or the communication among the computational nodes of a particular site. Furthermore, from the cluster level parallelism perspective, decisions made by the runtime system regarding the initial placement of application tasks to locally assigned computing resources can significantly influence the outcome of a cluster level scheduler. The scheduling goals differ from level to level and may be conflicting between levels. For instance, cluster level schedulers typically aim at maximizing fairness among all applications in terms of their execution time which may result in non-optimal execution times for certain applications. Application level schedulers typically aim at minimizing the execution time of a single application, which may result in non-balanced execution times among applications. Addressing the problem jointly at multiple levels is called multi-level scheduling and constitutes a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem.","Required qualifications

Teach Abroad Scholarship,English Language Centre,"Teach Abroad Scholarship
In response to the rise in Graduate unemployment and the continuing weakness in the  graduate job market, ELC has developed a Graduate TESOL Programme. TESOL (also known as TEFL) is the acronym for Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages, and there is a tremendous global demand for trained TESOL teachers.
As a Social Enterprise, our profits are re-invested back into providing employment and training opportunities, and we are therefore able to offer a number of Full Scholarships onto the Programme. Although primarily aimed at unemployed Graduates, Undergraduates are also eligible to apply for a scholarship and Final Year students in particular are encouraged to apply. 

In order to be considered for the next round of Scholarships, please send your CV and cover letter asap.

Our Programme consists of two key strands:
A 120-150 hour distance-learning Diploma TESOL Course; giving participants the skills, confidence, and qualifications necessary for TEFL work abroad.

A Job Advisory Service providing expert support to help participants find work and choose the most appropriate position for them personally. We work with quality Schools and Agencies throughout the world to make sure our students get the opportunity to apply for the pick of some of the best English Language teaching jobs around. 

The specific duties and remuneration you can expect when teaching abroad obviously varies depending on a range of factors, for example: location, size of school, type of school (private or state), age of students etc. Remuneration will always be considerably higher than the UK Minimum wage. One of the key roles of our Job Advisory Service is to help you decide what position would suit you best.
If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch by email at:admin@englishlanguagecentre.org 





Basic Requirements:
English as a first language or equivalent
Graduate or Undergraduate
Good communication skills
Enthusiasm about living and working abroad
Applications will be judged on their own merits and we do not wish to be overly prescriptive in terms of what we are looking for. Essentially, we want to know why you want to teach abroad and why you believe you should receive a Scholarship place. Enthusiasm and commitment are more important than previous teaching experience (though that may also be taken into account), and we would like to encourage as many people as possible from all disciplines to apply.",,0,Unrestricted,Unrestricted,Continuous,Unrestricted,,6-12 semester,https://www.internationalscholarships.com/scholarships/2527/

Secondary School Exchange Scholarship,ESU,"Since 1928, the ESU has offered thousands of young people the once in a lifetime opportunity to spend two or three terms in a private US high school, after A-levels.

Many scholars take the opportunity to study subjects they dropped at GCSE, or to go into more depth in their chosen degree subject, without the added pressure of A-levels. The study skills that can be gained from the exchange have proven to be beneficial at University: American teaching emphasises independence of thought, and discussions play a large part in the classroom.

SSE is also as much a cultural exchange as an academic one. Host schools offer an extensive range of extracurricular activities and facilities, as well as American rites of passage such as spring break, prom, and graduation.

Managing urban growth has become one of the most important challenges of the 21stcentury. In the world today, what kind of urbanisation will nurture sustainable growth and development? As the key to this challenge is an interdisciplinary solution, crossing traditional boundaries between academic disciplines, we are inviting graduate students from all academic programmes to provide helpful strategic recommendations. The idea is to gather contributions that are both theoretically grounded and offer pragmatic solutions to a relevant international development problem stemming from an interdisciplinary collaboration between 3 to 5 enrolled master students from anywhere in the world. 

Identify a challenge stemming from urbanization;  

Construct an interdisciplinary analysis on how it affects different aspects of development in a specific (but transposable) context; 

Propose innovation at the policy, practice, process or technology levels turning the challenge into development opportunity. The finalists will be invited to publically present their work in Geneva before a panel of highlevel experts.

RESEARCH GRANT - BIM/Nº52 - 29-04-2016 - CRACKIT,Instituto de Telecomunicações,"These research positions focuses on the research and development of a system able to process images of the surface of flexible road pavements, to allow for the automatic detection and characterization of road surface defects. Although cracks with linear development are considered the most common pavement surface degradation found by road inspectors, other important surface defects like cracks with alligator pattern, potholes, routing, raveling, among others, represent important data about pavement surface condition to allow for an adequate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of road pavement surface degradation. Images of road surface taken using imaging systems composed of one regular camera (considered as been non-expensive imaging systems) have been used by researchers, mainly on the detection of cracks with linear development. However, these images are 2D data structures, been difficult to detect defects like potholes, routing or raveling when processing them, because the depth information along a profile of the road defect is missing. Light-field cameras, capturing light ray directions, have recently become available. The processing of the richer light field images allows a more complete analysis of the road pavement surface, for instance supporting depth estimation. An alternative/complementary sensor that can be used for road surface defect detection is a mobile Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). From this type of sensor a 3D point cloud, representing the transversal profiles of a road lane, can be created for the desired analysis. This project exploits the usage of these two types of imaging sensors.

Dash Two Essay Writing Scholarship Contest For College Seniors and Juniors,Dash Two,"As incoming college juniors and seniors look to their future after graduation, they don't often get the chance to look back and consider what they might have done differently. At DASH TWO we'd like to encourage students to think about how they might have used social media differently during their first years in college. So we're offering a $1000 scholarship for the best essay by a college student on that very topic.

For many students social media offers a way to make new friends and take a break from their studies. Some even use social networks to establish professional connections and enter the business world before graduating. Unfortunately sometimes social media can also lead to interrupted studying, unwanted drama and the destruction of one's reputation.

We hope our essay writing contest can be an opportunity for juniors and seniors to consider how they might have used social media differently but not just for the sake of reminiscing. Looking back on social media usage in one's early college years can be a way of using social media more effectively before leaving college. In addition, improving how one uses social media can be a boon as one enters the workplace and seeks new contacts while avoiding old mistakes.","Written by an incoming college junior or senior in the U.S.;

Furthermore, illness, injury, adverse events at home, or just plain bad luck often come at just the wrong time.

UFAW Animal Welfare Student Scholarship,UFAW,"Through its Animal Welfare Student Scholarships, UFAW aims to encourage students to develop their interests in animal welfare and to provide them with an opportunity to conduct relevant research or other (eg educational) projects. In these, and its other awards, UFAW wishes to promote high quality research that is likely to lead to substantial improvements in animal welfare. UFAW seeks to promote both fundamental research aimed at providing new insight into the subjective mental experiences of animals relevant to their welfare and at understanding their needs and preferences, and also to promote applied research aimed at developing practical solutions to animal welfare problems.Student Scholarships consist of £200 per week subsistence allowance for the Scholar plus £50 per week to the department for project expenses. Although typically completed during the summer vacation, projects may be carried out at any time and usually last between four and eight weeks. Support is provided for up to 8 weeks, although projects themselves may be longer than this. Payments are made prior to the commencement of the project by cheques made out to the Scholar and the Supervisor’s Department. Scholars are asked to present their research findings at the Annual Scholars Meeting held in universities around the UK. First held in 1999, these free-to-all, popular meetings have proved to be very enjoyable and successful occasions, with the Scholars reinforcing the impression that animal welfare science attracts the some of the brightest and best.","SApplications are welcome from individuals studying at universities or colleges in the British Isles or an overseas institution at which there is a UFAW University Link. Students will usually be undertaking courses in the agricultural, biological, psychological, veterinary or zoological sciences.

MSc students on appropriate courses will also be considered.

Projects may be carried out within the UK or overseas and must be relevant to improving the welfare of farm, companion, laboratory, zoo or free-living wild animals whose welfare is compromised by human factors.

Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship,Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,"In addition to the foundation’s program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or more
dissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would complete the writing of
a dissertation within the award year. These fellowships, in the amount of $20,000, are intended to
contribute to the support of the doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a
timely manner and are only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work.
This fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in comparison with each
other and not in competition with proposals for our research grant. Applicants may be citizens of any
country and studying at colleges or universities in any country.
Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change,
intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Dissertations
with no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will
also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other
funding sources.
Eligibility
These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate
school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If
analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident of completing the
dissertation within the year, he or she should not apply, as the application will probably not be
competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental
fields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in
those cases it is appropriate to apply.
Timing
Applications for dissertation fellowships must be submitted by February 1. Applications are
reviewed during the spring, with final decisions made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June.
Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards
ordinarily commence on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the
nature of the project makes this appropriate.","Taxation
A recipient of a dissertation fellowship may be liable for income taxes on funds awarded, depending
on whether the funds are used to pay tuition and certain other related expenses, the amount of the
recipient's other income, the law of the recipient's domicile, and other factors. The foundation does
not provide advice on tax matters. Applicants should consult their own tax advisors to determine the
tax consequences of receiving a dissertation fellowship.
Final Report
Recipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved and
accepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any papers, books,
articles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to the foundation.

Application Procedure
Applications are submitted online. The application link can be found on our web site, hfg.org. The
direct address is https://www.grantinterface.com/hfg/Common/LogOn.aspx. Applicants first create a
login account and then may access the online application. The deadline for submission is February
1 (midnight, EST). Late applications will not be considered.
(We will still accept a mailed application using our previous application method, a printable PDF
form, provided it arrives at the foundation’s office no later than February 1, or the following Monday if
February 1 falls on a weekend.)
A. Project Title
Complete all questions in this section that are applicable to your proposed project. Some questions
are required; these are marked with an asterisk (*).
B. Abstract and Survey
Enter an abstract by typing or pasting text. (Note the length limit.) The abstract should be an
informative but succinct description of the project, including its relevance to aggression and/or
violence. The survey questions--about the topics, time period, and geographic region of your
project--are for statistical purposes only; this information does not affect our evaluation of the
application.
C. Advisor's Letter and Advisor's Abbreviated C.V.
A letter from your advisor must be uploaded by the advisor using our online system. In the section
of the online application headed “Advisor Letter,” please follow the instructions to enter your
advisor’s email address and then click “Compose Email.” The system will prompt you to write an
email to your advisor asking that they provide a letter. We will then send your advisor an additional
email containing a link through which they may upload their letter. The letter should address the
significance of the research and affirm that all requirements for the Ph.D. except the dissertation
will have been satisfactorily completed at the beginning of the award period and that preparation
for the dissertation is such that it will be completed within the academic year for which the
fellowship is requested. (If this is not true, the advisor is doing the applicant no favor by saying it
is. It would be better to encourage the advisee to wait until the appropriate time to apply.) The
advisor’s letter is due by February 15.
Please upload an abbreviated (two-page) version of your dissertation advisor's curriculum vitae.
(You will not be penalized, however, if you are unable to shorten or obtain a shortened version of
your advisor's C.V.)
D. Applicant's C.V. and Graduate School Transcript
Upload your own curriculum vitae of no more than two pages in length. Please arrange for your
university to mail a copy of your official transcript to the foundation at the address below. The
transcript should arrive at the foundation’s office by February 15. If your Ph.D. program does not
involve graded coursework, include an explanation of the university's requirements.
E. Project Description
Describe guiding theories, methods, study populations, etc., and explain how the dissertation
research augments your discipline's body of knowledge. If your analysis is far enough along that all
or some of your findings can be conveyed, discuss them. This is a chance to convince the
foundation that a project is worth funding. Be concise, but give sufficient detail for a proper
evaluation. Research plans are typically about 15 double-spaced pages (not including footnotes or
references listed in a bibliography). Supplementary supporting material is not necessary but may be
submitted.
3
F. Protection of Subjects
If your project’s subjects are living humans, or people with living relatives or associates whose lives
may be affected by the research, indicate what has been done to protect their safety or privacy. If
subjects are non-human animals, the foundation must be assured that you have avoided subjecting
them to unnecessary discomfort or harm. If your research involves documentary work concerning
people long dead or otherwise incapable of being harmed, this should be stated.
G. Other Support
Describe facilities and resources already available for dissertation support. A Harry Frank
Guggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship may be accepted in conjunction with other
awards, fellowships, or employment. A $20,000 fellowship can only contribute to the support
needed over the course of a year. Do you have other sources of support? Will you be working?
Have you applied for other fellowships? Alternatively, it may be that a $20,000 award will support
you for full-time work for a few months. We like to see that an applicant has thought about these
practical matters.","$20,000 USD",Unrestricted,Unrestricted,February 1,Unrestricted,Please see website for more information,10,https://www.internationalscholarships.com/scholarships/613/

Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation Research Grants,Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,"The foundation welcomes proposals from any of the natural and social sciences and the humanities that promise to increase understanding of the causes, manifestations, and control of violence and aggression. Highest priority is given to research that can increase understanding and amelioration of urgent problems of violence and aggression in the modern world.

Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change, intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Research with no relevance to understanding human problems will not be supported, nor will proposals to investigate urgent social problems where the foundation cannot be assured that useful, sound research can be done. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources.

The Research Grant

Most awards fall within the range of $15,000 to $40,000 per year for periods of one or two years. Applications for larger amounts and longer durations must be very strongly justified. The foundation awards research grants to individuals (or a few principal investigators at most) for individual projects and does not award grants to institutions for institutional programs. Individuals who receive research grants may be subject to taxation on the funds awarded.Final decisions are made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in December. Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Grants ordinarily commence on January 1 but later starting dates may be requested if the nature of the research makes this appropriate.

Education and Citizenship

Applicants for a research grant may be citizens of any country. While almost all recipients of our research grant possess a Ph.D., M.D., or equivalent degree, there are no formal degree requirements for the grant. The grant, however, may not be used to support research undertaken as part of the requirements for a graduate degree. Applicants need not be affiliated with an institution of higher learning, although most are college or university professors.

Application

Applications are submitted online. The online application will be available beginning April 1st. Applicants will first create a login account and will then be able to access detailed guidelines and the online application.","Taxation
HFG awards research grants to individuals for individual projects. However, a grantee may
choose to have these funds administered through her institution for reasons of convenience and/or
necessity. If the grantee so directs, the grant will be administered and accounted for by the
institution on behalf of the grantee in accordance with the budget prepared by the grantee and
included with the application (subject to revisions approved by the foundation). Please see the
section below entitled “Individual vs. Institutional Applications” for detailed instructions.
Regardless of whether the grant funds are paid to the grantee directly or paid to an institution on
behalf of the grantee, the grantee may be liable for taxes on funds awarded, depending on locality,
tax status, timing, nature of the award, etc. Applicants should consult their own tax advisors to
determine the tax consequences to them of receiving a research grant.

part of the requirements for a graduate or doctoral program. Applicants need not be affiliated with
an institution of higher learning, although most are college or university professors. 
2
Budget Guidelines
Proposals should be accompanied by a precise budget. Please refer to the budget worksheet at
hfg.org/rg/hfg_budget.pdf. This should be 1) downloaded, 2) completed and saved, and 3) then
uploaded in the Budget section of the application. Your budget should cover only one year;
applicants who are applying for two years of support will submit a detailed second-year budget if an
award was granted for the first year. In addition to the budget worksheet, you will need to submit a
budget explanation that justifies each item in the worksheet.
Requests will be considered for salaries, employee benefits, fieldwork, research assistantships,
supplies and equipment, essential secretarial and technical help, and other items necessary to the
completion of a project. The foundation does not supply funds for overhead costs of institutions,
travel to professional meetings, self-education, elaborate fixed equipment, dissemination of research
findings, or—to repeat—graduate-degree research (except for salary for research assistants or funds
awarded through our Dissertation Fellowship, described later). The foundation will not consider
applications for the support of meetings or conferences.
As noted above, the majority of grants from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation range
between $15,000 and $40,000 per year, for one or two years, depending on the nature of the
research. The size of our grants says something about the research we support. We aim to attract
applications for projects that can be done within that range, and we expect budget requests to match
the specific needs of the project. We will not contribute a portion of costs to a project with other
funding unless an independent ""Guggenheim component"" of the research can be identified and
shown to make a difference to what can be accomplished by the larger project, which must be fully
funded otherwise. Be aware that many solid pieces of research are proposed to us each year that can
be carried out well within these budget limitations; projects that require significantly more money are
simply not appropriate for funding by this foundation.
Salaries
In general, a salary is only justified if paid work will be given up to free up time for the specific
research project proposed to us. In these cases, we need to know the applicant’s base salary, the
duties she is expected to fulfill, what she will give up in duties and salary to conduct the research
proposed, and how that relates to the salary requested from us.
Here are some general guidelines to follow when asking for salary support:
• We generally do not fund projects that require an investigator’s full-time effort, except in
cases of extended fieldwork, archival research, sustained writing projects, or other intensive
work.
• We will consider requests for supplementation to a sabbatical half-salary, up to what we
allow.
• Requests for 2%, 5%, or even 10% of a researcher’s time appear to add nothing to the active
scholarly engagement available for a project, especially when these requests come from
university professors whose salaries already cover time for research.
• As most university professors are expected to conduct research during the time they do not
teach, summer salaries are not a priority for the foundation and will be considered only with
an adequate explanation for why the project cannot be conducted without such
compensation.
• Request either salary or a per diem allowance during fieldwork, but not both.
• Applicants without a salaried job should request a salary commensurate with local rates for
someone with comparable qualifications. 
3
Fieldwork
Since the foundation prefers to make contributions exclusively to the direct costs of research, we
commonly fund the costs of fieldwork, including travel, living expenses, local research assistance,
insurance, transcription costs, necessary software/equipment, visa fees, gifts/remuneration for
informants or survey participants, and other relevant expenditures. As with any other requests,
these items should be thoughtfully justified:
• Requests for airfare/travel expenses should be accompanied, if possible, by documentation
of the average price for economy class tickets.
• When requesting funds for vehicle rental/local transportation, please give an approximation
of how much these services will cost per day.
• Per diem living expenses should represent an honest estimate of the costs of the research
proposed. If an applicant is not familiar with the average living expenses where she will be
working, she might consult with regional experts. The U.S. Department of State web site
provides per diem rates by country, and the web site of the U.S. General Services
Administration (GSA) provides per diem rates by U.S. city. (These figures should be taken
as guiding rather than binding.)
Research Assistance and Secretarial Help
We support research projects conducted by individuals, or a few principal investigators at most,
with student assistance or fieldwork help when necessary, for specific tasks appropriate to assistants.
If students are substantial collaborators on the project, we expect to review each one's c.v. and list of
publications, as with other professional collaborators. Student assistants must be paid only for the
work they do, and at reasonable rates for junior researchers. We do not contribute to tuition or
other university fees related to their status as students. Please do not try to hide tuition costs under
the category of ""benefits.""
Fees for ""consultants"" are generally not allowed. If the principal investigator cannot do the
work without substantial expert advice, then we consider that she may not be the right person for
the project.
It is appropriate to ask for secretarial help if a research project entails clerical tasks that are
specific to that project. If so, describe that work and include a c.v. for the person to be employed.
General office support, calculated as a percentage of a secretary's regular salary, is not an allowable
budget item.
Equipment and Supplies
Ask only for equipment and supplies needed for this research project. While not all requests are
as clearly fictional as the recent application with a budget line of $1,000 for ""pens, pencils, etc.,"" we
do not consider general office supplies to be essential to a research project. Nor do we want to
supply funds for a personal computer or any other equipment unless it is necessary to the project
and unavailable otherwise. These restrictions exist in order to maximize the number of projects that
can be supported.
Application Procedure
Applications are submitted online. The application link can be found on our web site, hfg.org.
The direct address is https://www.grantinterface.com/hfg/Common/LogOn.aspx. (Applications
using our older form, a printable PDF and its accompanying guidelines, will still be accepted if they
arrive at the foundation’s office by the deadline.) Applicants first create a login account and then
may access the online application. The deadline for submission is the end of August 1
(midnight, EST). Late applications will not be considered.

Additional Notes
Here we provide some guidance on those items that tend to cause the most confusion. Of
course, you should feel free to contact the foundation before submitting a proposal if you have a
concern not addressed in these guidelines.
Multiple Principal Investigators
If the proposal involves collaboration of two or more principal investigators, a single member of
the research team, the one filling out the application, becomes the primary contact. He or she will
serve as the chief correspondent regarding the application’s completeness and notification of the
foundation’s decision on the proposal.
When completing Section A, the primary contact should list his/her contact information.
Additional PIs should include their contact information in their CVs. Only the primary contact
completes Section K. Electronic Signature.
Individual vs. Institutional Applications
We provide a place in Section A to indicate whether you are applying as an individual or through
an institution. The foundation has no preference as to whether the applicant submits the proposal
as an individual or has the host institution submit it and administer it on the applicant's behalf
through an office of sponsored research or equivalent. .
If applying as an individual, do not complete the Institutional Contact information within Section
A.
If applying as an institutional applicant, please do provide that information. The contact person
usually will be a department head, research coordinator, or representative of a university’s office of
sponsored research. We will cc the contact on matters of the application’s completeness and to
notify of the foundation’s decision on the proposal. If the grant is approved, this person will serve
as the administrator of the awarded funds, ensuring that budgets are kept up-to-date and changes in
the status of the project are made known to the foundation.","$15,000 - $40,000 USD",Unrestricted,Unrestricted,August 1,Unrestricted,Please see website for more information.,15-30,https://www.internationalscholarships.com/scholarships/614/

Dissertation Fellowships from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation,"In addition to the foundation’s program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or more
dissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would complete the writing of
a dissertation within the award year. These fellowships, in the amount of $20,000, are intended to
contribute to the support of the doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a
timely manner and are only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work.
This fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in comparison with each
other and not in competition with proposals for our research grant. Applicants may be citizens of any
country and studying at colleges or universities in any country.
Questions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change,
intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Dissertations
with no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will
also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other
funding sources.
Eligibility
These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate
school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If
analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident of completing the
dissertation within the year, he or she should not apply, as the application will probably not be
competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental
fields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in
those cases it is appropriate to apply.
Timing
Applications for dissertation fellowships must be submitted by February 1. Applications are
reviewed during the spring, with final decisions made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June.
Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards
ordinarily commence on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the
nature of the project makes this appropriate.
Taxation
A recipient of a dissertation fellowship may be liable for income taxes on funds awarded, depending
on whether the funds are used to pay tuition and certain other related expenses, the amount of the
recipient's other income, the law of the recipient's domicile, and other factors. The foundation does
not provide advice on tax matters. Applicants should consult their own tax advisors to determine the
tax consequences of receiving a dissertation fellowship.
Final Report
Recipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved and
accepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any papers, books,
articles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to the foundation.","Applications are submitted online. The application link can be found on our web site, hfg.org. The
direct address is https://www.grantinterface.com/hfg/Common/LogOn.aspx. Applicants first create a
login account and then may access the online application. The deadline for submission is February
1 (midnight, EST). Late applications will not be considered.

form, provided it arrives at the foundation’s office no later than February 1, or the following Monday if
February 1 falls on a weekend.)

project--are for statistical purposes only; this information does not affect our evaluation of the
application.
C. Advisor's Letter and Advisor's Abbreviated C.V.
A letter from your advisor must be uploaded by the advisor using our online system. In the section
of the online application headed “Advisor Letter,” please follow the instructions to enter your
advisor’s email address and then click “Compose Email.” The system will prompt you to write an
email to your advisor asking that they provide a letter. We will then send your advisor an additional
email containing a link through which they may upload their letter. The letter should address the
significance of the research and affirm that all requirements for the Ph.D. except the dissertation
will have been satisfactorily completed at the beginning of the award period and that preparation
for the dissertation is such that it will be completed within the academic year for which the
fellowship is requested. (If this is not true, the advisor is doing the applicant no favor by saying it
is. It would be better to encourage the advisee to wait until the appropriate time to apply.) The
advisor’s letter is due by February 15.
Please upload an abbreviated (two-page) version of your dissertation advisor's curriculum vitae.
(You will not be penalized, however, if you are unable to shorten or obtain a shortened version of
your advisor's C.V.)
D. Applicant's C.V. and Graduate School Transcript
Upload your own curriculum vitae of no more than two pages in length. Please arrange for your
university to mail a copy of your official transcript to the foundation at the address below. The
transcript should arrive at the foundation’s office by February 15. If your Ph.D. program does not
involve graded coursework, include an explanation of the university's requirements.
E. Project Description
Describe guiding theories, methods, study populations, etc., and explain how the dissertation
research augments your discipline's body of knowledge. If your analysis is far enough along that all
or some of your findings can be conveyed, discuss them. This is a chance to convince the
foundation that a project is worth funding. Be concise, but give sufficient detail for a proper
evaluation. Research plans are typically about 15 double-spaced pages (not including footnotes or
references listed in a bibliography). Supplementary supporting material is not necessary but may be
submitted.
3
F. Protection of Subjects
If your project’s subjects are living humans, or people with living relatives or associates whose lives
may be affected by the research, indicate what has been done to protect their safety or privacy. If
subjects are non-human animals, the foundation must be assured that you have avoided subjecting
them to unnecessary discomfort or harm. If your research involves documentary work concerning
people long dead or otherwise incapable of being harmed, this should be stated.
G. Other Support
Describe facilities and resources already available for dissertation support. A Harry Frank
Guggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship may be accepted in conjunction with other
awards, fellowships, or employment. A $20,000 fellowship can only contribute to the support
needed over the course of a year. Do you have other sources of support? Will you be working?
Have you applied for other fellowships? Alternatively, it may be that a $20,000 award will support
you for full-time work for a few months. We like to see that an applicant has thought about these
practical matters.
